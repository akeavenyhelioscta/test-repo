----------------------------------------------------
-- ICE TICKER DATA — end-of-day summary per product
-- Grain: 1 row per trade_date × symbol
--
-- Aggregates tick-level trades into:
--   OHLC (open / high / low / close)
--   volume, VWAP
--   trade counts — total, Lift (aggressive buy), Hit (aggressive sell), Leg (spread)
--   block-trade flagging (conditions ILIKE '%block%')
--
-- Hit/Lift convention (verified empirically via MCP against actual ICE data):
--   ICE's "Set By X" = "the X side of the book REMAINED as the new reference
--   AFTER the trade" — NOT "X side was the aggressor". Counterintuitive but
--   confirmed: SetByBid trades execute at the ask and tick price UP (buyer
--   lifted offer), SetByAsk trades execute at the bid and tick price DOWN
--   (seller hit bid).
--
--   Conditions ILIKE '%SetByBid%' → Lift (buyer lifted the offer, aggressive BUY)
--   Conditions ILIKE '%SetByAsk%' → Hit  (seller hit the bid, aggressive SELL)
--   Conditions ILIKE '%Leg%'      → spread leg (not directional — excluded from buy/sell)
-- ICE may wrap multiple flags in one comma-separated string, so ILIKE matching
-- is used throughout.
--
-- Carries symbol metadata + delivery window (strip / start_date / end_date)
-- through from staging_v1_ticker_data.
--
-- Note: `trade_date` is publisher-local (Mountain) calendar day — derived
-- from exec_time_local during the scrape. Convert to EPT at the call site
-- if you need to align with PJM market hours.
