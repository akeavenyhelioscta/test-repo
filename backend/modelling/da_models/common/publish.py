"""Single source of truth for the ``pjm_model_outputs.forecast_runs`` upsert.

All forecaster families publish through this function -- see
``backend/modelling/README.md``. Each family owns ``build_payload`` and
``extract_onpeak_forecast`` in its own ``publish.py``; this module owns the
row layout and delegates the DDL + write to
``backend.utils.azure_postgresql_utils.upsert_to_azure_postgresql`` -- which
``CREATE SCHEMA / TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` on first call, COPYs the row into a
temp table, and upserts on the primary key. (That helper also appends its
own ``created_at`` / ``updated_at`` audit columns to the table.)

``run_date`` is the *vintage* of the forecast -- the date it was produced,
not the date it delivers (``target_date``). For a "delivery is tomorrow"
run they're a day apart; once balance-of-week runs land, ``target_date -
run_date`` is the lead, and ``WHERE target_date = ? ORDER BY run_date``
shows a fixed delivery day's forecast evolving across vintages. It is a
plain column, not part of the PK -- ``run_id`` already makes rows unique,
so every run is kept and "latest" stays derived.

Run-creation timestamps live in the ``payload`` jsonb (``created_at_utc`` /
``created_at_local``); the table's row timestamps are the helper's
``created_at`` / ``updated_at``.

Row layout written here (one row per run, identified by ``run_id``)::

    pjm_model_outputs.forecast_runs (
        model_family                  text,
        model_name                    text,
        run_date                      date,
        target_date                   date,
        da_lmp_total_onpeak_forecast  numeric(10,2),
        payload                       jsonb,
        run_id                        uuid,
        created_at                    timestamptz,  -- added by the helper
        updated_at                    timestamptz,  -- added by the helper
        PRIMARY KEY (model_name, target_date, run_id)

    DDL + write are delegated to ``upsert_to_azure_postgresql``: the

    call, then each call upserts a single row keyed by
    ``(model_name, target_date, run_id)``. Re-invoking with the same
    ``run_id`` overwrites the row (idempotent retry); a fresh ``run_id``
    appends a new one.

    ``run_date`` is the forecast vintage (typically ``target_date - 1``).
